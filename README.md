A modest proposal is a bitter and darkly hilarious satire of English indifference to the suffering of the Irish poor. 

It was written during the height of a terrible famine in Ireland because of a proposed devastating tax on the Irish.

Swift does not write with his own "voice" but someone who does not recognize the barbarity of his "solution".
